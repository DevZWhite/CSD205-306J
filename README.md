# Python CSD205-306J

## Overview

This repository contains source code and exercises focused on **learning Python** as part of a programming course at **Bellevue University**. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate foundational to intermediate Python concepts through hands-on practice, reinforcing core programming principles such as problem solving, clean code structure, and documentation.

The project emphasizes writing readable, maintainable Python code while gradually introducing more advanced language features.
